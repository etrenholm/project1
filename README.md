## Description
Create a unique trivia app which allows users to customize their own quiz experience by choosing a category and a level of difficulty for the questions. Once a user chooses their journey, they battle against themselves to surpass  previous scores in each of the three levels of difficulty. The user continues to answer questions until they answer incorrectly, at which time the game ends and they receive a piece of inspirational advice to maintain a positive attitude.
